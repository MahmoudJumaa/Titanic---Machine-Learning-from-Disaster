# Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains my solution to the Titanic survival prediction competition on Kaggle. I used passenger data from the Titanic disaster to build a Random Forest Classifier model that predicts survival outcomes. The approach involved data exploration, feature selection, one-hot encoding, model training, and generating a submission file.
